This was my final week project in Harvard's CS50, Introduction to Computer Science Course.
I wrote the template files and application file, **but the code for running the website onto localhost with Flask was given by CS50.**
The website allows users to sign up and create a username and password saved in the database for future log-ins.
The website allows for user to quote, buy and sell stocks with virtual (not-real) cash. 
It is able to do this with a market API to quote real-time stock prices.
The transactions are recorded onto the database and can be seen in history of transactions page when the user logs on.
The html templates include buy and sell , and also their respective confirmation pages.

This was my first experience linking front-end to back-end and has been a nice introduction to what goes behind a website on the internet.
